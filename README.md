# Gerrymandering-Project
This project was done as a part of my Introduction to Programming class. We learned about the concept of gerrymandering. The python program that we built calculates the wasted votes and the efficiency gap between years 1970 to 2020. 

This project enalabled me to learn about strong manipulation, working with nested dictionaries and tuples, and most importantly, learning how gerrymandering impacts elections and the future of a government.
Comments have been added in the code for clarification.
